# Syncsmart Takehome Challenge - Gabriel Gutierrez

## Requirements
- ✅ Use https://create.t3.gg/ to initialize a new NextJS app using the "pages" router.
- ✅ Create a developer account in HubSpot. Make two test portals in HubSpot.
- ✅ You can use "private app tokens" to authenticate with HubSpot’s API or go the distance with OAuth.
- ✅ Use MUI (https://mui.com/material-ui/) as your component library.
- ⚠️ Use Typescript to the best of your ability.
- ✅ Find a library for generating fake data and make a page on your app with a button that generates 100 contacts in one of the test accounts. The contacts should at least have a first name, last name and email.
- ✅ Make another button that pulls those contacts from the first HubSpot portal and creates them in the second HubSpot portal.
- ✅ Add spencer@syncsmart.io as a user to your HubSpot test portals.
- ✅ Record and share a video showing your process, results and work. [Loom Video](https://www.loom.com/share/c3d55c3b997c416fb22a296a1fbf357f)

Bonus Points For:

- ❌ Authentication
- ✅ A ReadMe that documents the features implemented (Here!)
- 😻 Treat these "requirements" as open-ended and non-strict. The goal is to show off your skills and impress your future co-workers.
